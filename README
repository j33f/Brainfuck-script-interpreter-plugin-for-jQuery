A simple Brainfuck interpreter plugin for jQuery released under the WTFPL <http://http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/>

It makes you able to use such a script :

<script language="brainfuck">
  ++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
</script>

if you need to pass some inputs to the script, just put them into a "data-input" attribute as this :

<script language="brainfuck" data-input="my input goes here">
  your brainfuck script here
</script>

You can, of course, comment your script !

USAGE

Look at the end of the index.html example file, at the end.
If your js files are not into a folder called "js", edit the plugin and worker js files and change files path.

Enjoy
